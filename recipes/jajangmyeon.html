        <p>Jajangmyeon (짜장면)—also called jjajangmyeon zha jiang mian—is a Korean noodle dish consisting of a rich, 
            dark sauce made from black bean paste (also known as chunjang and jjajang), and poured over fresh noodles.
            Chefs and home cooks often add pan-fried pork and stir-fry vegetables to the dish.</p>

        <p>This Chinese-Korean fusion dish, which immigrants from the Shandong region of China brought to Korea in the
            early twentieth century, is now a staple at Chinese restaurants across South Korea. The name “jajangmyeon” 
            (sometimes spelled jjajangmyeon) comes from the Chinese word “zhájiàng,” meaning “fried sauce,” and “myeon” 
            meaning “noodles.”</p>

        </ul>

        <h4>Method</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat the pork shoulder dry with a paper towel, and slice it into ½-inch cubes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the mirin, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil,
                ginger, garlic, and pepper. Add the cubed pork to the bowl and stir to coat.
                Allow the pork to marinate at room temperature for 10–15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the jjajangbap sauce in a small bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat,
                combine the black bean paste, vegetable oil, brown sugar, and rice wine.</li>
            <li>Stirring frequently, cook the sauce until slightly thick, about 3 minutes. 
                Remove the pan from the heat, and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the meat. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot, add the marinated pork to the pan and cook until the meat is no longer pink, 3–4 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, bring a large pot of cold water to a boil. Add the noodles to the hot water and boil until cooked,
                about 3–4 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and zucchini to the pan with the pork and cook until the vegetables have softened slightly, 2–3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the cabbage to the pan and cook until it softens, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the black bean paste mixture to the pan and stir to coat the meat and vegetables in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken stock and cornstarch slurry into the pan and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Stirring occasionally, cook until the sauce has thickened up to your liking, about 2–4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Divide the noodles into 4 serving bowls. Top each bowl of noodles with a ¼ of the saucy meat
                and vegetable mixture and garnish with thinly sliced cucumbers before serving.</li>
        </ol>
