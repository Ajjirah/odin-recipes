    <h4>Method</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak the chickpeas overnight in enough water to cover them. In the morning, drain the water.</li>
        <li>In a pressure cooker add the soaked and drained chickpeas, 2 tea bags, bay leaves, cardamom,
            cinnamon stick, salt and 4 to 5 cups water. Pressure cook at high flame till you get 1-2 whistles.
            After that lower the flame to medium and let the chickpeas cook for another 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add cloves and grated onions. Fry the onions till the 
            smell goes away and they are light golden brown in color.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 3-4 minutes till the smell of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Now add the tomato puree , stir and let it cook for 12-15 minutes on medium-low flame. Cover the pan to prevent the splash all around.</li>
        <li>Add the chole masala, red chilli powder, paprika powder, cumin powder, salt and mix for a 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chickpeas next and stir will all the chickpeas are coated with the spices, around 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add water (which was used for boiling the chickpeas), cover the pan and let it simmer at medium-low flame for around 30 minutes.
            The gravy will thicken after 30 minutes so add water accordingly.</li>
        <li>To temper, heat 1 tbsp of ghee in a pan and the ginger julienne to it.</li>
        <li>Fry till the juliennes are golden brown in color but do not burn them. Add to the chole curry, mix and switch off the flame.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some garam masala, kasuri methi and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve with roti, paratha or plain rice.</li>
